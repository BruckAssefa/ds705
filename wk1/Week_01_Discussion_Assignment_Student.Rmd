## Let me introduce myself to you. 

My name is Paul Isaacson. I live in Minneapolis, MN. I was born in Madison, WI and raised close by in Middleton, WI. I did my undergraduate at UW – Eau Claire (Psychology and Web Dev minor). I am a father of two boys, 3 and 9. I enjoy camping and National Parks. Most recently, I was in the Badlands with my family.

For over five years, I have worked as both a business intelligence analyst at a global manufacturer of medical carts and currently as a data quality analyst at a non-profit health and retirement benefits administrator.

### Why I want to learn about data science: 

From early on in my career, I questioned things. Why are we doing it this way? How can we do it better?

Recently, as part of a team building exercise with my department at work, I was given the Meyer-Briggs Type Indicator. I scored as an INTJ, also known as The Architect. This seemed to fit me well. The following excerpt sums it up pretty well:

Rules, limitations, and traditions are anathema to the INTJ personality type everything should be open to questioning and reevaluation, and if they see a way, INTJs will often act unilaterally to enact their technically superior, sometimes insensitive and almost always unorthodox methods and ideas.

I will continue to ask how I can do better, how the team can do better, and how the business can do better. It is my drive for improvement that has brought me to data science. I believe intelligent analysis using data science tools is the key to improving processes.


#### What is your background in statistics?

As an undergraduate, I studied Statistics for Psychology. I was also exposed to some concepts in DS 700 and DS 710. Finally, I have taken independent study courses through Khan Academy.
