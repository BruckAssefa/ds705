View the presentation by Bruce Weaver titled Silly or Pointless Things. His point is that normality tests are not very powerful for small samples and probably too powerful for large samples. The Central Limit Theorem says means will be normal, which helps bring test statistics into correct sampling distributions and t-tests are robust, so if the graph seems reasonable symmetric with no outliers then skip the normality test and use the t-test. The discussion question: Is it worth taking the time to test for normality when thinking about performing a t-test or constructing a t-interval? Provide reasons for your answer.

The author makes a convincing argument to not over rely on normality test. I thought he made an interesting point in regards to the fact that if the sample is small the test is not very powerful and when the sample is large the test may be too powerful. Compounding that, normality is less important the greater the sample size. That being said, I do believe there is still value in assessing the probability the sample is from a normal distribution. However, it may not be the most important factor or even that important all together. It can still provide information as to the populations you are studying. If one does not test for normality, they would still need to look for outliers.
